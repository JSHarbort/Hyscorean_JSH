Hyscorean
==========

Hyscorean is an open-source package of EleXsys and MATLAB software with graphical user-interface for acquiring non-uniform sampled HYSCORE data and for analyzing, both, uniform and non-uniform HYSCORE data, including validation and EasySpin-based fitting. For more information see the [open-access publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2019.106576).

The online documentation [page](https://hyscorean.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html) contains a list of the full functionality provided by the software as well as illustrated instruction for its use.


Requirements
-------------

The following programs/packages are required in order to run Hyscorean:

 * MATLAB 2016b-2024b *(required)*
 * Report Generator *(optional)*
 * Parallel Computing Toolbox *(optional)*
 * Image Processing Toolbox *(optional)*
 * Easyspin 5.2 -6.0 (optional)
 
 *(required)* - Required for running minimal functionality <br>
 *(optional)* - Required for additional functionality

 Note that MATLAB versions 2025a and later break the functionality of the GUI in Hyscorean (which uses some Java elements). 

Installation
-------------

A detailed description of the installation steps can be found on the [Installation](https://hyscorean.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/installation.html) page of the online-documentation.
